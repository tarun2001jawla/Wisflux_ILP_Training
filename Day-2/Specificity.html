      Specificity is the algorithm that the browser uses to decide which
      property value is applied to an element
    </p>

    <p>
      As the body has been set to have a color of red this is inherited through
      the descendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can change the color by targeting the element with a selector, such as
      this <span>span</span>.
